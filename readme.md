# Association studio

The app helps to analyze the actually existing implementations of the association metrics.
The analysis implies computing the metric values in a GUI featuring two bounding boxes.
The user is able to move and rotate one of the boxes. The values of the currently selected
association metrics are calculated and represented instantly.
